### Overview
Large Language Models (LLMs) are a disruptive force, changing how research was done in many sub-areas of AI. Planning is one of the last bastions that remain standing. The focus of this workshop is on the questions in the intersection of these areas. Some of the specific areas we would like to gain a better understanding in include: what LLMs can contribute to planning, how LLMs can/should be used, what are the pitfalls of using LLMs, what are the guarantees that can be obtained.

### Topics of Interest
We invite paper submissions on the following (not exhaustive) list of topics:

* Algorithms and theories of planning with pre-trained or fine-tuned LLMs.
* LLMs for (partial) model elicitation.
* LLMs for search guidance or search pruning.
* LLMs for planning modulo theories.
* LLMs as proxies for user preferences.
* Validation/verification of plans, policies, or models.
* Generalization in planning and generalized planning with LLMs.
* Using LLMs to develop interfaces for planning-related problems.
* Other applications of LLMs in planning.
* Other applications of large vision-language models (VLMs) in planning.
* Planning for LLMs and VLMs.

### Important Dates
Paper submission deadline: **August 5th, 2025, AoE**  (extended)  
Paper acceptance notification: **September 8th, 2025, AoE**  

ICAPS will be in-person this year. Authors of accepted workshop papers are expected to register for the workshop, physically attend the conference and present in person.


### Submission Details
We solicit workshop paper submissions relevant to the above call of the following types:

Long papers – up to 8 pages + unlimited references / appendices  
Short papers – up to 4 pages + unlimited references / appendices  

Please format submissions in AAAI style (see instructions in the [Author Kit](https://aaai.org/authorkit25) ). Authors submitting papers rejected from other conferences, please ensure you do your utmost to address the comments given by the reviewers. Please do not submit papers that are already accepted for the main ICAPS conference to the workshop.


Paper submissions should be made through [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=icaps-conference.org/ICAPS/2025/Workshop/LM4Plan).
