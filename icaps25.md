### Overview
Large Language Models (LLMs) are a disruptive force, changing how research was done in many sub-areas of AI. Planning is one of the last bastions that remain standing. The focus of this workshop is on the questions in the intersection of these areas. Some of the specific areas we would like to gain a better understanding in include: what LLMs can contribute to planning, how LLMs can/should be used, what are the pitfalls of using LLMs, what are the guarantees that can be obtained.

We invite paper submissions on the following (not exhaustive) list of topics:

* Algorithms and theories of planning with pre-trained or fine-tuned LLMs.
* LLMs for (partial) model elicitation.
* LLMs for search guidance or search pruning.
* LLMs for planning modulo theories.
* LLMs as proxies for user preferences.
* Validation/verification of plans, policies, or models.
* Generalization in planning and generalized planning with LLMs.
* Using LLMs to develop interfaces for planning-related problems.
