### Overview
Language Models (LMs) are a disruptive force, changing how research was done in many subareas of AI. Planning is one
of the last bastions that remain standing. The focus of this workshop is on the questions in the intersection of these areas. Some of the specific areas we would like to gain a better understanding in include: what LMs can contribute to planning, how LMs can/should be used, what are the pitfalls of using LMs, what are the guarantees that can be obtained.

### Invited Speakers

#### Samy Bengio
* **Affiliation:** Apple
* **Bio:** Samy Bengio is a senior director of ML research at Apple since 2021, and Adjunct Professor at EPFL, Switzerland, since 2024. Previously, he was a distinguished scientist at Google Research since 2007 where he was heading part of the Google Brain team. Before that, he was at IDIAP, where he co-created the famous open-source Torch library. He is interested in many areas of machine learning research, such as deep architectures, representation learning, vision and language processing, and reasoning.

#### Noam Brown
* **Affiliation:** OpenAI
* **Bio:** Noam Brown is a Research Scientist at OpenAI working on multi-step reasoning, self-play, and multi-agent AI. He previously worked at FAIR (Meta), where he helped developing CICERO, the first AI to achieve human-level performance in the strategy game Diplomacy. He was also part of the project that created the first AI to defeat top humans in no-limit poker.

#### Yoav Shoham
* **Affiliation:** Stanford University and AI21 Labs
* **Bio:** Yoav Shoham is professor emeritus of computer science at Stanford University. Prof. Shoham is Fellow of AAAI, ACM and the Game Theory Society. He has received several prestigious awards during his career, including: the IJCAI Research Excellence Award, the AAAI/ACM Allen Newell Award, and the ACM/SIGAI Autonomous Agents Research Award. Prof. Shoham has founded several AI companies. He also chairs the AI Index initiative, which tracks global AI progress, and WeCode, a nonprofit initiative to train high-quality programmers from disadvantaged populations.

#### Peter Stone
