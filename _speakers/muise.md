<!-- Whatever you write below will show up as the speaker's bio -->

<!-- Christian is an Assistant Professor at Queen's University in Kingston, Canada. He completed his PhD under the supervision of Professors Sheila McIlraith and J. Christopher Beck in the area of Automated Planning, with the Knowledge Representation and Reasoning Group at the University of Toronto. Following his PhD, he was a post-doc for two years with the University of Melbourne's Agentlab studying techniques for multi-agent planning with a project on human-agent collaboration, and then subsequently a Research Fellow with the MERS group at MIT's CSAIL. Just prior to joining Queen's he was a Research Staff Member for two years at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. -->

**Bio**: 
Christian Muise is an Assistant Professor in the School of Computing at Queen’s University. He is a member of the Ingenuity Labs at Queen’s University, an active Scotiabank Scholar with the Scotiabank Centre for Customer Analytics, and a Faculty Affiliate with the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Dr. Muise’ area of focus is on the understanding and modelling of sequential decision making problems, with a focus on model acquisition from structured time series data and unstructured sources such as natural language and images.

**Abstract**:
LLM’s have proven themselves to be incredibly adept at converting content from one representation to another. At the same time, they’ve seriously struggled to auto-complete their way through complex planning tasks in unseen domains. To that end, there is a growing trend to bridge natural language and planning solutions through the intermediate Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). This talk details some of the recent work the Mu Lab has conducted that focuses on going between natural language and PDDL, in either direction, using the field’s seasoned understanding of how planning models are built. In particular, we’ll cover (1) a new framework for creating NL -> PDDL pipelines; (2) a paradigm for using planning techniques to create narratives; and (3) a new project that explores how planning models can be extracted from existing narratives.
