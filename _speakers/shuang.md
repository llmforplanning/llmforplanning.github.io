<!-- Whatever you write below will show up as the speaker's bio -->

<!-- Shuang earned her Ph.D. degree from MIT in Aug 2023. She will start as an Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto and Vector Institute in Fall 2024. Shuang is interested in developing AI systems that generalize to a wide range of novel tasks and continually learn from the environment. Her research explores methods to incorporate compositionality into deep learning models, giving rise to stronger generalization abilities for solving more challenging novel tasks. Her research involves Generative Modeling, Embodied AI, and Vision-Language Understanding. Shuang is a recipient of the Meta Research Fellowship, Adobe Research Fellowship, MIT Seneff-Zue CS Fellowship, EECS Rising Star, ICML Outstanding Reviewer, and best and outstanding paper awards at NeurIPS workshops. -->
